# Socket-Programming

A program that involves a client and a server. The client sends server 4 values, for example X, n, B, C where, X is the adjacency matrix of a directed graph with 5 nodes A B C D E, and n is the length of the path from node B to node C.The server responds back with two responses: 
(a) positive Y response (or negative N response) if there exists (or doesn't exist) a path of length n from B to C.
(b) the image of the directed graph with nodes A B C D E proving the validity of the response.
For simplicity, assume a 5-node graph with nodes named A, B, C, D, E
